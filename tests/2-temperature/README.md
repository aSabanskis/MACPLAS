# Temperature solver test

Verification of the temperature solver is handled by the ```run.sh``` script which compares transient 1D numerical solution with three different boundary conditions to the analytical solutions for a semi-infinite homogeneous medium, as well as stationary 2D (axisymmetric) solution to the exact analytical expression.
